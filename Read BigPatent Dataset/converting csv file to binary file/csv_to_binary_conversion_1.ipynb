       "'referring now to the drawings and first to fig1 a and 1b , a tubing conveyed perforating gun ( tcp gun ) incorporating an adiabatic detonating mechanism constructed in accordance with the present invention is illustrated generally at 10 . the tcp gun 10 may incorporate a plurality of sub assemblies ( subs ) including a firing head illustrated generally at 12 which is adapted to achieve detonation of an explosive chain including detonating cord . the tcp gun also includes one or more perforating subs illustrated generally at 14 and incorporating a plurality of spaced shaped charges which are disposed for detonation by the detonating cord which extends to and is coupled with the primer of each of the shaped charges . referring now particularly to the firing head sub assembly 12 , a coupler 16 is provided which defines an externally threaded upper extremity 18 enabling the tcp gun to be received at the lower internally threaded extremity of the well tubing string . the coupler 16 also defines a tapered internal guide surface 20 which serves to guide the lower striking end 22 of a drop bar 24 into an internal passage 26 so that the drop bar , shown in broken lines , will be accurately aligned for its striking and releasing function the passage 26 is typically described as a &# 34 ; no - go &# 34 ; passage which is of a sufficiently small dimension so as to permit only the striking portion of the drop bar to pass through the passage 26 and actuate the firing mechanism of the gun . virtually all other objects of sufficient weight to actuate the firing mechanism of the gun will be of sufficiently large dimension that , if accidentally dropped into the working tubing string , will be of larger dimension than the no - go passage 26 and therefore will be stopped at the coupler 16 . the lower end of the coupler 16 is provided with an externally threaded section 28 which is received by an internally threaded section 30 of an upper housing tube 32 which is also referred to as a debris sub . the upper end of the debris sub defines an internal sealing surface 34 which is engaged by external sealing members 36 which are supported within seal grooves formed within the coupler 16 . upper housing 32 is a &# 34 ; debris sub &# 34 ; for pipe rust , scale or other undesirable material to accumulate leaving the top of firing head 12 to perform its function . the debris sub may be sealed at its upper and lower ends by o - rings at 36 and 50 or left unsealed depending on the completion string design requirements . at times the debris sub 32 may be perforated or slotted . the tcp gun 10 also includes an intermediate coupler 38 having upper and lower externally threaded ends 40 and 42 which respectively receive the lower internally threaded end 44 of the upper housing tube 32 and the internally threaded upper end 46 of a housing tube 48 . a safety spacer , not shown which is a section of tubing 10 feet or so in length which positions the perforating gun beneath the rig floor for protection of rig personnel as the firing head detonating mechanism is being connected or disconnected is often included the housing tubes 32 and 48 are sealed with respect to the intermediate coupler by means of respective pairs of seals 50 and 52 . within the gun housing tube 48 is provided a plurality of shaped charges , one of which is shown at 54 which is positioned at one of a plurality of reduced housing sections 56 to permit ease of housing penetration by the explosive jet that is developed when the shaped charge is detonated . each of the shaped charges is coupled with a length of detonating cord 60 . the detonating cord extends through the safety spacer and into the housing tube 48 and also along the length of gun tube housing 62 and other subsequent gun tubes such that detonation of the detonating cord will achieve consequent detonation of all of the shaped charges to thereby induce perforation of the well casing by the explosive jets of the shaped charges . the tcp gun may be of any suitable length designed for achieving perforation of the well casing throughout the length of the casing intersecting the production zone to be produced . as shown in fig1 b , other gun intermediate couplers ( such as that shown at 61 ) may be provided which permit additional perforating gun sections 62 to be assembled end to end to thereby establish a tcp gun of desired length . the lower gun housing section 62 is closed by means of a lower end cap 64 having an externally threaded lower extremity 66 and spaced circular seals 68 which are respectively received by the lower internally threaded end 70 and sealing surface 72 of the lower gun housing section 62 . the lower end cap 64 also serves as a closure and retainer for the lower detonating cord connector 74 of the lower tcp gun section 62 . since the gun sections are capable of being assembled end - to - end , the detonating cord connector 74 will be substantially identical with respect to the detonating cord connector 76 shown at the lower end of the upper tcp gun section of the lower housing tube 48 . it should be born in mind that the tcp gun sections illustrated herein are of conventional nature and comprise a component part of the present invention only to the extent that the same is employed in combination with the adiabatic detonating mechanism set forth in fig1 a . it should also be born in mind that the adiabatic detonating mechanism of fig1 a is capable of being employed in various other casing perforating gun systems and therefore is not intended to be limited to the particular tcp gun system shown in fig1 b . further , it is envisioned that the adiabatic detonating mechanism of fig1 a may be effectively employed for achieving ignition of combustible material in apparatus finding use other than for tubing conveyed perforating guns used in the completion of deep wells for the production of petroleum products . referring now specifically to the adiabatic detonating mechanism of fig1 a , and to the more detailed illustration of fig2 a , the intermediate coupler 38 also forms an internally threaded upper end 78 within which is received the externally threaded intermediate portion 80 of a cylinder support 82 . the cylinder support is sealed with respect to an internal sealing surface 84 of the intermediate coupler by means of a circular sealing element 86 supported within an appropriate seal groove of the cylinder support . a tubular cylinder 88 is positioned in concentric relation within the upper housing tube 32 by means of the cylinder support 82 . the lower end of the cylinder 88 defines an externally threaded section 90 which is received by internal threads 92 of the cylinder support . the cylinder support is sealed with respect to the cylinder support by means of one or more circular seals 94 having sealing engagement with a sealing surface defined by the lower end of the tubular cylinder 88 . as shown in fig2 a the cylinder support 82 by means of the external threads 83 at its lower end may also function as a connector for the upper end of the explosive chain of the adiabatic detonating mechanism of this invention . as shown at the lower portion of fig1 a an explosive barrel 96 having an explosive assembly therein is shown to be connected to the lower end of the cylinder support by means of a - threaded not connector 98 and is also shown to be exposed to an internal gas chamber 100 of the cylinder by means of a firing port 102 which is a short bore also defined by the cylinder support . by threaded attachment of the explosive barrel to the lower end of the cylinder support 82 the cylinder support is not affected by detonation of the explosive 106 and 108 and is reusable . only the explosive barrel 96 will be replaced because of the high order detonation within its explosive chamber which can deform it and which will rupture the wall 124 . the detailed structure of the explosive barrel 96 and its arrangement of explosive detonating composition is illustrated in detail in fig2 a . as shown , the explosive barrel defines a blind bore 104 within which is seated a section 106 of a secondary high explosive composition such as rdx , hmx , hns and pyx , which serves a component part of the detonator system for achieving detonation of detonating cord which in turn detonates the shaped charges with which the perforating gun is provided . the use of a secondary high explosive composition as the detonator of the explosive barrel provides an optimum safety feature for the adiabatic detonating mechanism of this invention . the direct adiabatic initiation of a secondary high explosive composition is less sensitive and therefore a more safe explosive as compared with the highly sensitive and more dangerous primary high explosives ( such as lead azide ) which are ordinarily employed in percussion caps for detonation of detonating cord in casing perforating guns . also located within the explosive barrel 96 , and preferably in spaced relation with the section 106 of secondary high explosive composition , is a section 108 of secondary high explosive composition which may , if desired , be composed of the same secondary high explosive as the explosive segment 106 . the blind bore 104 is enlarged at its upper portion and defines an internal stop shoulder against which is seated the lower end of an internally directed liner 114 which provides support for the upper explosive segment 108 and concentrates explosive energy of the explosive 108 against the lower explosive segment 106 . element 107 is a metallic bore moisture barrier for the explosive materials of the explosive barrel 96 . the upper explosive segment 108 further defines an upper surface area 116 having a depression 118 formed therein to increase the surface area which is exposed to the internal chamber 100 of the tubular cylinder 88 after the metallic face 107 has ruptured . the upper explosive segment 108 is detonated adiabatically by sudden increase in the temperature of the gas within the chamber 100 and the firing port 102 in the manner described hereinbelow and concentrates energy to accelerate high order detonation of the explosive segment 106 . it has been determined through tests , though the explosive segment 106 is composed of a secondary high explosive composition such as rdx and a low order explosion would ordinarily be expected , nevertheless , a high order explosion is induced in the secondary high explosive composition by virtue of the arrangement of the explosive segments 106 and 108 within the explosive barrel 96 . these tests , which were conducted with only rdx , a relatively insensitive but powerful secondary explosive commonly used in oil well charges , achieved a high order detonation in a secondary high explosive composition . the direct initiation of secondary high explosives is an important advantage of the adiabatic detonating device . since highly sensitive and more dangerous primary high explosive compositions are not required for detonating cord detonation within the spirit and scope of this invention the resulting adiabatically initiated firing head is imminently more safe to use as compared with conventional percussion type firing heads . in the preferred embodiment of fig2 a the upper end of a booster charge 120 ( identical to those between other gun subs ) will achieve detonation of the detonating cord . blind bore 104 is terminated by a thin partition 124 which is readily ruptured upon detonation of the explosive segment 106 . if desired , the detonating cord detonating mechanism may incorporate a booster barrel such as shown at 126 which defines a receptacle 128 within which is received the lower end of the explosive barrel 96 . booster barrel 126 defines a booster chamber 130 within which is positioned booster charge 120 . the lower end of the booster charge device forms a tubular connector 121 within which the detonating cord 60 is positioned and secured by crimping the connector tube . although , for simplicity a safety spacer is not illustrated , for purposes of safety a length of tube would be coupled to the lower threaded end of coupler 38 and would be provided with a gun intercarrier head at its lower end which in turn would provide for connection with the upper end of gun housing section 48 . the detonating cord 60 would then extend from the adiabatic firing head , through the safety spacer and gun intercarrier head to the first gun section in the perforating string . it is not intended to limit the present invention to the specific explosive barrel and secondary explosive charge construction shown in fig2 a . for example , the upper explosive segment 108 may simply be of cylindrical form not requiring a focusing liner such as shown at 114 . additionally , for purposes of handling and ease of installation , the explosive segments 106 and 108 are preferably lined but may be lined or unlined as desired . or , if required , the focusing configuration of the upper explosive segment may be formed in the explosive composition without the necessity of providing a liner as shown . the desired shape of the lower end of the upper explosive segment may be formed by the explosive composition itself . with reference to fig2 b , an alternative embodiment of this invention is illustrated by the partial sectional view wherein the cylinder support 82 is provided with an externally threaded lower end 83 which receives a connecting nut 98 to retain an explosive barrel 96a in sealed assembly therewith . o - ring sealing element 97 forms a seal with the lower end of the cylinder support . the upper portion of the explosive barrel 96a forms a blind bore defining a receptacle 104a for an explosive composition . the lower portion of the explosive barrel 96a forms a blind bore defining a receptacle 104a for an explosive composition . the lower portion of the explosive barrel 96a defines a downwardly directed blind bore 121 which is separated from the upper bore 104a by a thin partition 124a that easily transmits detonation but forms a pressure barrier between the adiabatic firing device and the rest of the gun system . the blind bore 121 is open at its lower end to receive commercial booster shell 123 containing secondary high explosive crimped to an appropriate detonating cord 60 . a booster retaining nut 125 threaded to the lower end of the explosive barrel 96a holds the closed end of the booster against the thin partition 124a and suspends the detonating cord 60 . the alternate configuration of fig2 b also shows the explosive barrel with segments 105 and 106 formed of secondary high explosive but without a metallic liner 114 as in fig2 a . in this configuration the blind bore 104a contains explosive segments which are formed by compressing secondary high explosive powder in several separate steps with the most densely compacted portion at the lower end at the thin partition 124a and becoming progressively less compacted , toward the upper end and therefore more easily initiated where the portion of least compaction becomes exposed to the adiabatically heated gas . this technique of varying the explosive compaction is well known in the explosives industry for enhancing the deflagration to detonation transition ( ddt ) and is well suited to the adiabatic ignition method of this invention as mentioned above , it is a primary feature of this invention to provide a method and mechanism for adiabatically inducing detonation of an explosive composition to thus provide apparatus having characteristics of much greater safety from the standpoint of handling , running into the hole , firing and retrieval in the event the apparatus fails to fire . as also mentioned above , conventional firing mechanisms typically incorporate percussion mechanisms for achieving detonation of the explosives . these detonating mechanisms typically incorporate very sensitive and primary high explosive material such as lead azide . such conventional devices can detonate while being handled and can also become detonated as they are run into the hole or being retrieved from the hole . in the event that a percussion detonator fails to fire , the gun assembly must be pulled from the well during which jarring or dropping the pipe may cause the released firing pin to restrike , possibly detonating the gun . although very strict precautions are always taken to insure against malfunction , the presence of percussion caps and apparatus for striking the same significantly increases the possibility that the perforating gun can malfunction which is detrimental to workers and equipment . according to the principles of this invention an adiabatic detonating mechanism is employed which is of simple construction and which is imminently safe during handling , during transportation and at the rig site and while being run into the hole or being retrieved from the hole . should the apparatus fail to fire , it quickly returns to its safe condition when the adiabatically induced heat dissipates to a level below the detonation temperature of the explosive compound , such that inadvertent firing , since there need be no percussion or piercement of the initiating means , is almost impossible . as shown at the upper portion of fig1 a , the tubular cylinder 88 is shown to form an internal cylindrical surface 132 which receives a firing piston 134 therein which is sealed with respect to the cylindrical surface 132 by means of one or more circular piston seals 136 that are received appropriately within seal grooves or in the piston . the piston 134 is provided with a downwardly projecting rod 135 , preferably a polished rod which is receivable in close fitting relation within the firing port 102 as the piston approaches the downward extent of its pressure induced travel . the rod 135 is provided with a stop shoulder 137 which contacts the upwardly facing surface 119 to limit downward travel of the piston . at the lowermost position of the rod 135 the end surface of the rod will ordinarily have a few thousandths of an inch clearance with the upper surface of the explosive such that the rod never contacts the explosive . if desired , however , the apparatus may be designed to cause the rod to contact and compress the explosive to any extent that may induce the desired explosive characteristics . the rod will function as a piston and will achieve enhanced compression of gas trapped within the bore 102 thereby enhancing the adiabatic heat to which the explosive 108 is subjected . the tubular cylinder defines an externally threaded upper end portion 138 which provides for a threaded connection thereto of a piston retainer cap 140 . the firing piston 134 and the piston retainer cap 140 define registering transverse bores which receive one or more shear pins 142 to secure the piston against movement within the cylinder until such time as the shear pin is sheared . the piston 134 also defines a striker portion 144 which projects upwardly above the level of the piston retainer cap 140 . the striker portion is intended to be struck by the lower striking end 22 of the detonation bar 24 . when the detonation bar is dropped through the production or working tubing string , it is guided by surface 20 through the no - go passage 26 and into contact with the striker portion 144 of the piston . the piston retainer cap 140 is also provided with a positioning device 147 which insures proper positioning of the piston retainer cap and the striker portion of the piston in centralized relation within the upper housing tube 132 so that the lower end 22 of the detonation bar will contact the striker portion of the piston . when the shear pin 142 is sheared , the piston 134 is released and is capable of being driven downwardly by fluid pressure that is present within the upper housing tube 32 . although this fluid pressure may be provided by any one of a number of suitable sources , a most convenient source of fluid pressure is the pressure that is developed by the hydrostatic head of fluid such as drilling or completion fluid that is present in the tubing above or below a packer or present in the annulus between the casing and tubing when the perforating gun is positioned for firing at the proper formation level within the well . in most wells the column of completion fluid above the gun provides an abundance of hydrostatic pressure that is available to provide a proper hydrostatic pressure for operation of the adiabatic firing mechanism of this invention . a hydrostatic pressure acting upon the surface area prescribed by the seal 136 of the firing piston 134 will develop a pressure induced force acting upon the piston and urging the piston downwardly toward the explosive composition located below the internal gas chamber 100 . this downwardly directed force is restrained by the shear pin 142 or by any other suitable means for preventing piston movement until piston movement is desired . the gas chamber 100 of the cylinder 88 may include any gaseous composition . it has been found , however , that air at atmospheric pressure will function quite readily for adiabatic heat detonation of the explosives . to insure that the piston 134 is driven downwardly at its greatest possible velocity in response to the pressure induced force applied thereto , the piston retainer cap 140 defines large fluid inlet ports 146 and 148 which , apart from the passage 150 of the retainer cap through which the striker portion of the piston extends , will permit substantially unrestricted inlet of the hydrostatic pressure fluid medium into the gas chamber 100 above the piston . thus , the piston will be driven downwardly at high velocity , causing substantially instantaneous compression of the gas within the chamber 100 . this instantaneous increase in gas pressure adiabatically induces an instantaneous temperature elevation of the gas to a temperature exceeding the detonation temperature of the upper explosive segment 108 . when this occurs the explosive segment 108 will ignite , developing a detonation of at least intermediate order which will then be applied via the focusing aspects defined by the lower inverted liner configuration of the explosive segment 108 . the focused explosive energy of segment 108 will be directed against the upper end of the explosive segment 106 which , though it is composed of a secondary high explosive compound , will achieve high order detonation . the high order detonation of explosive segment 106 will induce detonation of the detonating cord 60 or the booster for the detonating cord as the case may be . under circumstances where the upper explosive segment 108 , the explosive segment 106 or the detonating cord fails to detonate and the tcp gun fails to fire , the adiabatic detonating mechanism will very quickly return to its normal , safe condition as the adiabatically induced heat of the gas is quickly dissipated into the surrounding metal surfaces of the tubular cylinder and cylinder support and other components of the well . at the formation level the piston 134 will remain in its gas compressing position determined from the stop surface 119 provided by the cylinder support 82 at the lower end of the cylinder 88 . also , at this position of piston 134 the lower end of the compression rod will be spaced a few thousandths of an inch above the upper face of the explosive barrel 96 . thereafter , the piston can not again compress the gas and achieve adiabatic elevation of its temperature and therefore the upper explosive segment 108 can not thereafter be adiabatically detonated . since the adiabatic detonating mechanism of this invention will very quickly return to its safe condition upon failure to fire , the working string may be quickly and safely removed from the casing and a replacement tcp gun with an adiabatic detonating mechanism may be substituted for it and quickly run into the hole for another gun firing sequence . as the adiabatic detonating mechanism is withdrawn from the well bore , the hydrostatic pressure that will occur continuous y as the tool is moved upwardly through the liquid column in the well will allow the compressed gas within the chamber 100 to expand , thus moving the piston upwardly within the cylinder 88 . as the tool reaches the surface , the gas within the chamber 100 will have expanded almost completely and its pressure will have dissipated substantially to atmospheric level . thus , the piston 134 becomes pressure balanced during its release and detonation sequence and this pressure balanced condition is sustained thereafter even though the hydrostatic pressure to which the apparatus is subjected at the firing level dissipates as the tcp gun is removed from the well . thus , after firing , it is not possible for the piston to again function to achieve adiabatic elevation of the temperature of the gas to the detonation temperature of the explosive composition . although the firing piston 134 may be efficiently restrained by a shear pin such as shown in 142 , such is not intended to limit the spirit and scope of this invention as shown in fig3 a piston restraint and controlled release mechanism of the ball detent may be provided . in this case the upper end of a tubular cylinder 152 defines ball detent openings 154 which receive locking balls 156 which are receivable within a locking detent groove or slot 158 of the firing piston 160 . thus locking the piston against movement within the cylinder 152 . an external ball retainer sleeve 162 surrounds the cylinder 152 and positions a locking shoulder surface 164 thereof for restraining movement of the locking balls . the sleeve 162 also defines an internally relieved area 166 which permits lateral movement of the balls 156 when the sleeve has been moved downwardly sufficiently to bring the relieved area 166 into registry with the locking ball openings 154 . downward movement of the locking sleeve 162 may be induced by means of the force applied by a detonating bar such as that shown at 24 in fig1 a . alternatively , downward movement of the locking sleeve 162 may be induced hydraulically , if desired , such as by increasing the hydrostatic head of the liquid within the working string or by controlling and using differential pressure between the tubing , casing annulus above a packer and the internal tubing or &# 34 ; rat hole &# 34 ; pressure , thus causing the sleeve which will be sealed by o - rings to other structural components of the firing head to be moved downwardly as a piston . this invention , therefore , is intended to encompass any suitable structure that is capable of retaining the piston against a downwardly directed force induced by any suitable means and then releasing the piston under controlled manner for sudden gas compressing downward movement under circumstances where the hydrostatic pressure of the liquid within the working string may not be sufficient for application of sufficient force to the piston to achieve adiabatic compression of the gas to the ignition temperature of the explosive medium . it will be desirable to provide for multiplication of the force that is developed by the hydrostatic pressure which is present . in such case , an alternative embodiment of the present invention may conveniently take the form as shown generally at 170 in fig4 a and 4b . in this case an elongated tubular member 172 is provided which is internally threaded at its lower end 174 and is supported by a cylinder support member 176 in much the same manner as shown in fig1 a and 1b . as piston member 178 is positioned for movement within the cylinder 172 and is sealed with respect to the cylinder by means of a circular sealing element 180 . a piston retainer cap 182 is coupled to the upper end of the cylinder 172 by means of a threaded connection 184 . the piston retainer cap defines a vertical passage 186 through which the upper striker portion 188 of the piston extends so that it may be struck and driven downwardly by means of a detonation bar such as that shown at 24 in fig1 a . the piston 178 is restrained in its uppermost position as shown in fig4 a by means of a shear pin 190 which extends through registering transverse bores formed in the piston and in the piston retainer cap . the detonating bar will drive the piston 178 downwardly , causing the pin 190 to shear and thus releasing the piston for downward movement under the influence of hydrostatic pressure acting upon the surface area defined by the piston seal 180 . for piston force multiplication the piston 178 is provided with a downwardly extending piston shaft 192 having a second piston 194 of smaller dimension as compared with piston 178 , located at the lower end of the piston rod . the piston 194 is sealed with respect to a second tubular piston cylinder 196 by means of a circular sealing element 198 . the piston chamber 200 defined by the upper cylinder 172 is in communication with the annulus 202 which is formed between the inner and outer cylinders 172 and 196 . thus a significant volume of gas within chamber 200 is available for compression by the large uppermost piston 178 . as the upper piston moves downwardly , its piston shaft 192 forces the lower piston 194 downwardly within the inner cylinder 196 . the gas present within the smaller piston chambers 204 and 206 defined by the smaller inner cylinder 196 will be acted upon by the force applied by hydrostatic pressure through the large piston 178 thus causing the smaller piston 194 to increase the pressure of the gas significantly above the pressure of the gas within the larger chamber 200 below the piston 178 . the lower piston chamber 204 is in communication with the upper explosive segment of the explosive chain via port 206 similar to the manner shown at 102 in fig2 a . the net result is that a hydrostatic pressure of smaller force potential may be multiplied to thus develop a force acting upon the piston 194 to achieve sudden pressure increase of the gas within chamber 204 and later 206 to elevate its temperature adiabatically to the detonation temperature of the explosive composition . the lower piston 194 is provided with a downwardly projecting polished rod 195 which is received in close fitting relation within the bore 206 as the piston approaches the downward limit of its travel . though no mechanical seal is developed between the polished rod and the wells of the receptacle 206 the close fit of the rod and receptacle functions in piston - like manner to achieve even greater compression of the gas and thus even higher adiabatic heat . in view of the forgoing , it is seen that the present invention is well adapted to attain all of the features hereinabove set forth together with other objects and features which are inherent in the apparatus itself . while the foregoing is directed to the preferred embodiment it is recognized that the apparatus may take on various other embodiments within the spirit and scope of the invention the scope hereof is determined by the claims which follow .'"
