as a drill bit . multiple , tapered and truncated exterior splines on the drive segments mesh with complementary interior splines on the adjacent receiving segments in the segment housings to enable slight angular positioning of the sets of drive and receiving segments on each other and facilitate dampening of drive vibration and bending of the drive string in or out of the chosen path in any desired direction as the drive string transmits rotational power in a curved path of desired magnitude from the drive mechanism to the output . the drive and receiving segments are typically connected internally by a bolt , nuts and belleville springs at the ends of the housings to form the drive string . in one embodiment a drill bit is mounted on the bottom one of the segments on the drive string for interval drilling . in another embodiment a selected number of drive and receiving segments and connected segment housings replace the flexible drive shaft coupling in a mud motor .', 'a device

in natural or man - made bodies of water such as lakes , rivers , sounds , straits , bays , shipping canals , shipping locks , harbors , and the like . the method is particularly useful in areas where ice breakers or the like cannot be efficiently operated . the method provides for direct replacement of heat lost to the atmosphere during the winter season by the use of heat transfer means such as permanent heat transfer apparatus located in and / or adjacent the sides of canals or rivers to prevent natural bridging of ice formations in the same or by the use of a traveling heat exchanger disposed in a barge , scow and the like .', 'a padlock with removable cylinder mechanism offers the user a choice of two distinct manners of operation or &# 34 ; functions &# 34 ;-- a key retaining function and a non - key retaining function . this dual function capability in a single unit is achieved by a rotator bolt bored to allow placement of a pattern of pins . a series of pins , which when installed in the rotator bolt in a specified pattern , causes the function selection to be accomplished . a re - keyable padlock which accepts widely available , standard dimensioned , generic key operated lock cylinders allowing the keying of this padlock to be adapted to the wide range of keying systems used in locks found in residential , commercial and other uses as required for security and convenience . the use of standard dimensioned cylinders in the padlock is accomplished by a cylinder retainer , tailpiece stop and rotator bolt which adapts the generic cylinder to padlock use . the cylinder retainer , which retains the lock cylinder in the padlock body , is in turn held in the body by a threaded screw which is accessible through the short shackle leg opening in the body only when the shackle is in the unlocked condition and swung clear of its body opening . upon removal of the threaded screw , the cylinder retainer and lock cylinder are removed from the body and the cylinder can be serviced or replaced .', 'a method for treating a subterranean formation comprising measuring mechanical properties of a formation comprising young &# 39 ; s modulus , poisson &# 39 ;

recycled , repeating the purification cycle .', 'apparatus for constructing modular buildings in which a reuseable framing structure is expanded to a shape desired of a building , building material is removably attached to the framing structure , fluent concrete is introduced to the building material , the framing structure is retracted with the building and removed . the framing structure has means for expanding its height and width . it also has means for changing the slope of its roof portion as well as changing the angles of its sides . thus , many different shaped building can be constructed with the same framing structure .', 'a bang - bang servo system controls motors which provide drive for trucks on each end of a fabric support beam structure . a plurality of such truck / beam / fabric units comprise a retractable roof separation of inner and outer truck guiding tracks / support platforms may be wide and somewhat variable . the radius of curvature of the inner and outer tracks may vary widely over the beam excursion path between open and closed roof conditions . individual beam motion sequencing and stop position are commanded through a central control unit . these features allow great flexibility and adaptability in application of this invention .', 'a lock , suitable for use in a car door , has a rotary latch which cooperates with a locking wedge , or the like , and can be locked by a locking pawl in a locking position . the pawl is actuatable by a setting device for bringing the rotary latch at least into an open position . in order to provide a lock which is of improved efficiency and is both compact in construction and operates reliably , transmission elements are arranged between the pawl and the setting device for transmitting movement of the setting device , in stepped - down fashion , to the pawl .', 'this application describes a device to convert an existing pool skimmer assembly into a pressurizable pool skimmer assembly which allows the existing pool skimmer assembly to act with this existing pool pump in emergency situations , such as assisting firefighters with pool water for extinguishing local wildfires or house fires . this method utilizes a removable plug cap and o - rings to allow the pool pump to draw the pool water from the poolmaid drain using the existing pool skimmer . this device can also be used to drain the pool for cleaning the pool or for winterizing the pool , with out the need for an electrical sump pump .']\n"
