apparatus for achieving adiabatic heat ignition of combustible material particularly explosive compositions which involves entrapping quantity of gas in chamber which is in communication with the combustible material and suddenly compressing the gas to the extent that the temperature thereof is increased adiabatically to the ignition temperature of the combustible material the apparatus is particularly adaptable for use as an adiabatic ignition device for detonating cord and shaped charges of perforating guns for completion of wells quantity of high explosive within an explosive barrel is in detonating proximity with the detonating cord cylinder forms an air chamber which is in communication with the explosive composition and is provided with piston for compression of the gas one or more shear pins or other locking devices are provided to secure the piston in immovable relation with the cylinder force is caused to act on the piston which force is typically induced by fluid pressure within the well which acts on the piston and which may also be induced as this force reaches predetermined magnitude or by means of weight bar dropped or lowered on wireline from the surface the piston will be released and the force will drive the piston into the cylinder compressing the gas sufficiently to raise the temperature of the gas adiabatically to the ignition temperature of the explosive composition  _END_\n","\n","\n","Review: invention uses methodology called function oriented material design fomd design materials specific demanding tasks order carry fomd first functions

in braced frame structure is provided the load limiting device may be placed in braced frame and connected to the braces of the braced frame the load limiting device is able to limit the lateral loads induced in the structure during dynamic event by plastic and ductile deformation the load limiting device by limiting the dynamic loads in the braced frame may protect other less ductile areas of the structure from the loads that might lead to extensive damage member failure and or structural collapse the load limiting device is positioned within braced frame structure and may be easily removed after it has undergone plastic deformation and replaced with an undeformed load limiting device the load limiting device exhibits elastic strength to survive without deformation minor load scenarios

\n","Original summary: padlock with removable cylinder mechanism offers the user choice of two distinct manners of operation or functions key retaining function and non key retaining function this dual function capability in single unit is achieved by rotator bolt bored to allow placement of pattern of pins series of pins which when installed in the rotator bolt in specified pattern causes the function selection to be accomplished re keyable padlock which accepts widely available standard dimensioned generic key operated lock cylinders allowing the keying of this padlock to be adapted to the wide range of keying systems used in locks found in residential commercial and other uses as required for security and convenience the use of standard dimensioned cylinders in the padlock is accomplished by cylinder retainer tailpiece stop and rotator bolt which adapts the generic cylinder to padlock use the cylinder retainer which retains the lock cylinder in the padlock body is in turn held in the body by threaded screw which is accessible through the short shackle leg opening in the body only when the shackle is in the unlocked condition and swung clear of its body opening upon removal of the threaded screw the cylinder retainer and lock cylinder are removed from the body and the cylinder can be serviced or replaced \n","Predicted summary:  an apparatus for use in

\n","Original summary: well data telemetry system for transmitting data along at least part of well bore containing tubing of magnetically permeable material comprises transmitting coil located to transmit magnetic flux signal along the tubing and or the surrounding geological formations modulation circuitry connected to the coil for modulating the magnetic flux signal in response to data signal and an magnetometer located to detect and respond to the magnetic flux signal at position spaced from the transmitting coil by using an magnetometer instead of conventional receiver coil to detect and respond to the magnetic flux signal the system is capable of responding to the low levels of signal which are likely to be received in practice furthermore the response of the magnetometer is independent of frequency so that the system may be used at low frequencies as well as high frequencies and demodulation of the transmitted signal can be effected without difficulty \n","Predicted

production of hydrocarbons with high and medium gas oil ratio from well with wellhead and bottomhole communicating with formation and with casing and tubing located inside the casing and forming space therebetween steps are performed and means are provided for establishing flow of hydrocarbon containing fluid inside the tubing from the bottomhole to the wellhead introducing gas into the space between the casing and the tubing so that the gas passes into the tubing and enhances the flow of the hydrocarbon containing fluid from the bottomhole to the wellhead with simultaneous reduction of pressure in the bottomhole resulting in an increase of pressure differential between the formation and the bottomhole and introducing in the bottomhole device which increases the pressure in the bottomhole so that the pressure differential between the formation and the bottomhole decreases and therefore gas blockage in near bottomhole zone of the formation is reduced to maintain an oil flow
